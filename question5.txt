Explain the difference between justify-items and justify-self using code examples.
=> Both justify-items and justify-self are properties used in CSS Grid to align grid items along the inline (row) axis.

 justify-items:-
      - The justify-items property is used on the grid container to align all the grid items within the grid cells.
      - It aligns the grid items in the inline (row) axis within their respective grid cells.

 Example:-

    .grid-container {
     display: grid;
     grid-template-columns: 100px 100px;
     justify-items: center; /* Align all grid items in the center of their respective cells */
   }
   
 justify-self:-
     - The justify-self property is used on individual grid items to override the alignment set by justify-items.
     - It allows each grid item to align itself within its own grid cell, independently of other items.

 Example:-

       .grid-item {
             justify-self: end; /* Align this specific grid item to the end of its cell */
          }
